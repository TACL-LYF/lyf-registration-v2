          TACL-LYF Camp will be split into two age-specific tracks: younger
          campers (rising 5th-8th grade campers) and older campers (rising 9th
          grade and older). This will allow us to better tailor our programming
          and activities towards specific age groups, as well as help us manage
          our growing camp. Here's what you need to know:
        </Typography>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Camp will be split evenly into a younger (rising 5th-8th grade
            campers) and older track (rising 9th grade + older). Registration
            for each track will be capped at a certain number, and will be
            conducted on a first-come first serve basis
          </li>
          <li>
            We will prioritize siblings and relatives when moving campers off
            the waitlists, to minimize accepting only one camper from a family
            or group of relatives
            <ul>
              <li>
                Please let us know if you are registering with relatives by
                leaving a comment in the “Additional Notes” section of the
                registration process
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Location and dates of of camp, logistics (e.g. drop-off, pick-up),
            and registration policies will be the same for all campers
          </li>
          <li>
            Campers from each track will still be able to interact with each
            other during meal-times, camp-wide activities, and cabin time
          </li>
        </ul>
