        Culture Committee on the leadership team is planning some fun activities and programming for campers this year and we would love to for you help!

        We recognize the importance of providing a strong cultural experience that is as
        genuine as the youth would experience in Taiwan and want to better understand how we can
        tailor the cultures experience in a summer camp that is closer aligned those experiences,
        This would help us execute certain programming and build up resources for not only our 
        campers, but also the needs of their parents.
