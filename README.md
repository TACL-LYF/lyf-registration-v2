# lyf-registration

This repo contains all of the code for LYF 2023 (and beyond) registration. It's structured into three directories:

1. [functions](functions/): Code for the Firebase Cloud functions
2. [migration](migration/): Code for the migration from the legacy PostGres SQL database into Cloud Firestore
3. [website](website/): Code for the website that displays camper information for each family and the admin dashboard for PDs to manage campers.

# Yarn Workspaces

Followed [this guide](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/typescript-monorepos-with-yarn) to add yarn workspaces support with TypeScript

1. Compile schemas with `yarn workspace schemas build`

## Registration

The camp registration system is a multi-step checkout flow that handles parent/guardian information, camper details, demographics, and payment processing through Stripe. The system supports pre-registration, waitlists, sibling discounts, and camp credit.

### Frontend Architecture

#### RegistrationFlow Component

**Location:** `/website/src/components/Registration/RegistrationFlow.tsx`

The main orchestrator for the entire registration process. It manages:

**Data Loading & Access Control:**

- Loads camp year information and family data (campers, parents, registrations, camp credit)
- Implements time-based access control with early access for pre-registered campers
- Access times are configured via `REGISTRATION_OPEN_FOR_PREREGISTERED` and `REGISTRATION_OPEN` constants

**State Management:**

- Uses React Context to provide registration data and dispatch functions throughout the flow
- Implements a reducer pattern (`registrationReducer`) to handle all state changes
- Action types include: AddParent, AddCamper, EditFamily, EditParent, EditCamper, EditDemographics, SetNumOfCampers, SetDonation, LoadFromCache, PrefillParent, PrefillFamily, LoadPendingPaymentRegistrations

**Session Persistence:**

- Saves registration state to browser's localStorage for session recovery
- Detects URL query parameters to handle:
  - `success`: Whether payment succeeded or failed
  - `waitlist`: Whether any campers were waitlisted
  - `continueFromWaitlist`: Resume registration after being moved off waitlist
- Shows a confirmation dialog to continue from previous session
- Validates that the same user and camp year are in the session

**Registration Steps:**
The flow consists of the following sequential steps:

1. **InfoStep** - General camp information and waitlist status
2. **ParentGuardianStep** - Parent/guardian contact information
3. **SelectNumCampersStep** - Choose number of campers to register
4. **CamperStep** (repeated per camper) - Individual camper details (name, birthday, grade, medical info, etc.)
5. **DemographicsStep** (repeated per camper) - Camper demographics (ethnicity, birthplace, language fluency)
6. **ReviewStep** - Review all information and proceed to checkout
7. **ConfirmationScreen** - Final confirmation after successful registration

#### RegistrationDataContext

**Location:** `/website/src/components/Registration/RegistrationDataContext.tsx`

Provides centralized state management for the registration flow:

**Data Structure:**

```typescript
{
  campYear: number,
  family: Family,
  parents: Parent[],
  campers: Camper[],
  demographics: Demographics[],
  donation: number
}
```

**Key Reducer Actions:**

- `AddParent/AddCamper`: Add new parent or camper to the registration
- `EditFamily/EditParent/EditCamper/EditDemographics`: Update specific fields
- `SetNumOfCampers`: Dynamically adjust number of camper/demographic entries
- `SetDonation`: Update donation amount
- `LoadFromCache`: Restore registration state from localStorage
- `PrefillParent/PrefillFamily/PrefillCamper`: Auto-populate fields from database
- `LoadPendingPaymentRegistrations`: Load registrations that were moved off waitlist

All state changes are automatically persisted to localStorage (except ClearData action).

#### ReviewStep Component

**Location:** `/website/src/components/Registration/ReviewStep.tsx`

The final review and checkout step before payment processing:

**Features:**

- Displays summary of all parent, camper, and demographic information
- Shows order summary with pricing breakdown
- Allows optional donation entry
- Validates all required fields before allowing checkout
- Handles navigation back to specific steps for editing

**Checkout Flow:**

1. Validates all required fields are completed
2. Calls `createCheckoutSession()` which invokes the Firebase Cloud Function
3. Handles three possible responses:
   - **Waitlist only**: No payment needed, proceed to confirmation
   - **Covered by camp credit**: No payment needed, proceed to confirmation with optional donation
   - **Payment required**: Redirect to Stripe Checkout

**Error Handling:**

- Shows user-friendly error messages via Snackbar
- Provides fallback contact information (lyf@tacl.org)
- Validates donation input (must be non-negative number)

### Backend Architecture

#### createRegistrationSession Cloud Function

**Location:** `/functions/src/registration/createRegistrationSession.ts`

The main server-side function that processes registration submissions and creates Stripe checkout sessions.

**Request Payload:**

```typescript
{
  campYear: number,
  parents: Parent[],
  campers: Camper[],
  donation: number,
  successUrl: string,
  cancelUrl: string,
  isTestData?: boolean,
  forceWaitlist?: boolean
}
```

**Processing Flow:**

1. **Authentication & Validation**

   - Verifies user is signed in (requires Firebase auth token)
   - Returns 401 error if not authenticated

2. **Camp Data Retrieval**

   - Fetches camp year data from Firestore
   - Gets pricing: `campPrice`, `preRegistrationFee`, `siblingDiscount`
   - Retrieves `remainingSpots` by camp track (YOUNGER/OLDER)

3. **Database Updates** (via `createOrUpdateRegistration`)

   - Creates or updates Family document
   - Creates or updates Parent documents
   - Creates or updates Camper documents
   - Creates or updates Registration documents with appropriate status:
     - `WAITLIST`: If `forceWaitlist` is true OR remaining spots <= 0
     - `PENDING_PAYMENT`: If spots available
   - Determines camp track based on camper's grade
   - Associates all documents via references

4. **Waitlist Handling**

   - Separates campers into `waitlistedCampers` and `registeredCampers`
   - For waitlisted campers:
     - Sends Slack notification to registration channel
     - Sends waitlist email to parent
   - If all campers are waitlisted:
     - Returns early with success (no payment needed)
     - If donation > 0, creates donation-only checkout session

5. **Registration Cost Calculation**

   - Base cost per camper: `campPrice`
   - Subtract pre-registration fee if applicable: `campPrice - preRegistrationFee`
   - Apply sibling discount: `siblingDiscount * (numCampers - 1)`
   - Retrieve and apply camp credit (financial aid)
   - Create Stripe line items for each registered camper

6. **Financial Aid Fast Path**

   - If total cost <= camp credit available:
     - Updates all registrations to `ACTIVE` status
     - Completes registration immediately (via `completeRegistration`)
     - Decrements camp track remaining spots
     - Returns success without Stripe session
     - If donation > 0, creates donation-only checkout session

7. **Stripe Checkout Session Creation**
   - Gets or creates Stripe customer ID for parent
   - Creates line items array:
     - One line item per registered camper
     - Optional donation line item
   - Applies discount coupon if applicable (sibling + camp credit)
   - Metadata attached to each line item:
     ```typescript
     {
       familyRef: string,
       registrationRef: string,
       campYear: string,
       campTrack: string
     }
     ```
   - Configures success/cancel URLs with waitlist flag if needed
   - Returns Stripe session ID for frontend redirect

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  status: "success" | "error",
  code: 200 | 401 | 402,
  sessionId?: string | null,
  isWaitlist?: boolean,
  message?: string
}
```

**Error Handling:**

- Logs errors to Firebase Functions logger
- Sends error notifications to Slack channel
- Returns user-friendly error messages
- Error codes:
  - `401`: Not authenticated
  - `402`: Failed to create Stripe customer or checkout session

#### createOrUpdateRegistration Helper

   - Frontend calls `createRegistrationSession` Cloud Function
   - Backend creates Stripe session with line items and metadata
   - Returns session ID to frontend

2. **Stripe Checkout Redirect**

   - Frontend redirects user to Stripe-hosted checkout page
   - User enters payment information on Stripe's secure platform
   - Stripe processes payment

3. **Webhook Fulfillment** (handled by separate webhook handler)

   - Stripe sends webhook event on payment success
   - Backend webhook handler:
     - Validates webhook signature
     - Updates registration status to `ACTIVE`
     - Records payment information
     - Decrements remaining spots
     - Sends confirmation email
     - Sends Slack notification

4. **Success Redirect**
